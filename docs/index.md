# Pacifica Internet Technology Package #

The Pacifica Internet Technology Package is a suite of cloud-based applications
that consists of three fundamental elements:

- simulcast streaming of your station's primary terrestrial FM broadcast

- audio archiving of your primary terrestrial FM broadcast

- notation and logging of copyrighted music played on your web stream

## Regular Maintenance ##

Once set up, the Confessor and Archiver need little attention. Twice per year
(depending on your location), you may need to adjust your schedule as you
transition into and out of
[Daylight Saving Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time). Use
[this guide](regular-maintenance/DST.md) to ensure you maintain the integrity of
your archives during these transitions.
