# Pacifica Internet Technology Package #

The
[Pacifica Internet Technology Package](https://pacificanetwork.org/pacificainternetpackage/)
is a suite of cloud-based applications that consists of three elements:

- [Simulcast Streaming](streaming/overview.md) of your station's primary terrestrial FM broadcast

- [Audio Archiving](archive/overview.md) of your primary terrestrial FM broadcast

- [Notation and Logging](confessor/overview.md) of copyrighted music played on your web stream

This guide is a work in progress and intends to document all these services.
