# Pacifica Confessor #

The Pacifica Confessor is a cloud-based application that helps stations with
several tasks:

- keeping track of the playout of copyrighted material (music)

- organizing and publishing the station's schedule

- directing the Archiver's program recording schedule

- reporting to performance rights organizations (e.g.,
  [SoundExchange](https://soundexchange.com/))

## Regular Maintenance ##

Once set up, the Confessor and Archiver need little attention. Twice per year
(depending on your location), you may need to adjust your schedule as you
transition into and out of
[Daylight Saving Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time). Use
[this guide](regular-maintenance/DST.md) to ensure you maintain the integrity of
your archives during these transitions.
