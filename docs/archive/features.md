# Pacifica Archive Features #

The Pacifica Archive includes several useful features for "time shifters". We'll update this list as time allows

## Track Metadata Display ##

As of May 2023, the newest Archive feature is the ability to show metadata for individual tracks within programs. This metadata comes from [ACR Cloud](https://acrcloud.com/), so you'll need to sign up for that in order for this feature to work ([contact us](mailto:info@pacifica-affiliates.org) if you don't already have ACR Cloud).

Here is what a typical playback session looks like for stations that do not have associated ACR Cloud accounts:

<table>
 <tr>
  <td><img src="example-archive-without-metadata.png" /></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td style="text-align: center;">Pacifica Archive Without Metadata</td>
 </tr>
</table>

Here is a view of the Archive for a station _with_ ACR Cloud integration and metadata enabled:

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>
    <video controls width="100%">
      <source src="archive-metadata-demo.webm" type="video/webm">
    </video>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td style="text-align: center;">Animated View of Pacifica Archive With Metadata</td>
 </tr>
</table>

Notice how the area above the player opens to display the metadata, and how it changes when the listener scrolls through the program.
