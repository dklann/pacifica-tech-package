# Pacifica Archiver #

The Pacifica Archiver is a cloud-based application that enables stations'
listeners to "time shift" their listening to stations' programs.

## Getting it Started ##

Once you have completed entering your station's schedule in the
[Confessor](../confessor/overview.md), you can
[start the archiving process](../archive/startup.md).
