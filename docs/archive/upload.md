# Uploading Shows #

You can create shows in your Archive that did not air on your station's signal.
You might want to do this as a way of offering additional content to your
listeners.

## Creating an Upload Show ###

Uploaded shows are created in the Archive. If you don't already have one, you
can create it:

- chose `Shows` in the menu on the right
- dropdown to 'Upload - KPFK Online Programming'
- click Add New Show button
- fill out form: the time and day determine where/when the show will appear in the archive
- update
