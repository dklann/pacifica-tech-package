# Replace a Recording in the Archive #

You can manually upload audio files to the Archive. You might want to do this
if, for example, the recorder fails to record a show at the intended time. You
can also offer shows in the Archive that you do not air on your normal broadcast
(see [this document](../archive/upload.md) for details).

Follow these instructions to replace the audio in the Archive with a locally
recorded audio file.

Before you start, make sure your local recording is an MP3 file with technical
parameters that match your stream (for example: compression at 128kbps, sample
rate of 44100, stereo). Also, ensure that you have edited the audio so that it
includes just the show you want to replace in the Archive.

- log in to the archive (using the administrative URL for your station's Archive)
- click `Upload` (as shown below)

<table>
 <tr>
  <td width="30%"><img src="menu-upload.png" /></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Uploading a replacement audio file</td>
 </tr>
</table>

- using the dropdown menus, pick the show and the instance (date/time)

<table>
 <tr>
  <td width="30%"><img src="pick-a-show.png" /></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Picking a show from the dropdown</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="30%"><img src="pick-a-date.png" /></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Picking a show date from the dropdown</td>
 </tr>
</table>

- either drag the file to the box that says `or drop file here` or click
  `Browse` and find the file on your local computer

<table>
 <tr>
  <td width="30%"><img src="browse-files.png" /></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Browse for a local audio file</td>
 </tr>
</table>

After the upload is complete, you are presented with a preview page. You can
play the new audio file and choose another if you need to, or click `Back to
Admin` to return to the Archive administrative menu.

<table>
 <tr>
  <td width="30%"><img src="preview-uploaded-audio.png" /></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Preview the audio</td>
 </tr>
</table>

The area to the right labeled **Show Report Guest/Topic** is for the Public File entry. You can ignore everything here if you're not entering data for the public file. In which case **DO NOT** click the `Update` button.
